Enquadramento
Physical-layer security sparked an interest on the generation of interference for secrecy purposes, by using otherwise silent devices to cause interference/jam adversary eavesdroppers that aim to overhear confidential communication.
We developed a combined coding and jamming scheme, whose basic idea lies in generating a short random key that is used to interleave/scramble information at the source, Alice. This key is then encoded with the message and removed from communication to the legitimate receiver Bob, during a period of advantageous communication over the eavesdropper Eve (e.g. due to more interference from a jammer device. Bob receives a better quality version of the interleaving/scrambling key, therefore having the needed advantage for secure communication against Eve.

Objetivo
The goal of this thesis is to perform a prototype implementation and evaluation of our physical-layer security scheme in a real-world test-bed of software-defined radios (SDR). In particular, the implementation will focus on using the legitimate receiver Bob as a source of interference against the adversary Eve. By causing interference to Eve and removing as much of self-interference as possible from itself, Bob will create the necessary advantage over Eve to achieve secure communication without having to resort to third-party jammers.
