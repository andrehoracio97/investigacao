What is Y4M?
YUV4MPEG2 is a simple file format designed to hold uncompressed frames of YCbCr video formatted as YCbCr 4:2:0, YCbCr 4:2:2 or YCbCr 4:4:4 data for the purpose of encoding, likely to MPEG-2. The part "YUV" in its name just derives from the fact that the color space YCbCr (used for color encoding in digital media) is often falsely mixed up with the color space YUV (used in analog PAL based applications, including analog TV and video tapes).
