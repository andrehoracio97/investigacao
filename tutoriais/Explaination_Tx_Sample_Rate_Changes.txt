Sample Rate Changes
====

NOTES:
(a) 1 sample can be a byte, 1 gr_complex, 1 float, whatever.
(b) when a "byte", can be any number of bits in [1,8]
(c) Assumes that there is enough data in the FEC Enc to form a frame. If there isn't, then no data will be encoded ... usually the final frame has this issue.
(d) Assumes that the host computer can keep data flowing to the USRP in real-time. If not, then there will be underruns noted in the USRP.

File Source: SR = N bytes / sec, each is 8 bits

Repack Bits (8:1): SR = N*8 bytes / sec, each is 1 bit

Stream Mux (+2): SR = N*8+2 bytes / sec, each is 1 bit

FEC Enc (R=2, k=7, frame=440, terminated): SR = 16*N+16 bytes / sec, each is 1 bit
=> R*INPUT+R(K-1)
=> 2*N*8 + 2*2 + 2*(7-1)
=> N*16 + 4 + 12
=> N*16 + 16

Stream Mux (+4): 16*N + 20 bytes / sec, each sample is 1 bit

Vector Sourse + Stream Mux (+96): 16*N + 116 bytes / sec, each is 1 bit

Stream to Tagged Stream: unchanged (1:1)

Repack Bits (1:2): 8*N + 58 bytes / sec, each is 2 bits

Vector Insert: ignoring since it's just once

Map: unchanged (1:1)

Differential Encoder: unchanged (1:1)

Chunks to Symbols: 8*N + 58 gr_complex / sec

Polyphase Arbitrary Resampler (x4): 32N + 232 gr_cmplex / sec

Multiply Const: unchanged (1:1)

USRP: M gr_complex / sec

=====

M == 32N + 232 gr_complex / sec
N == (M - 232) / 32 bytes / sec
