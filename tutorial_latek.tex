\section{INTRODUCTION}

SOMETHING

\section{GETTING STARTED}
We need a Linux base for getting started, this installing guide was meant to Ubuntu 18.04 or the Ubuntu 19.04.
\subsection{Installing VOLK}
First of all we will install VOLK (Vector-Optimized Library of Kernels) because we will not use the internal VOLK of GNU Radio but an external one. VOLK it's a free library that contains kernels for mathematical operations, this means that for an operation is created a proto-kernel and added to VOLK for the architecture that we wish, hence faster operations. To install this follow the next commands:
\begin{itemize}
    \item git clone https://github.com/gnuradio/volk
    \item cd volk \&\& mkdir build \&\& cd build
    \item cmake ..\/
    \item make \&\& make test \&\& sudo make install \&\& sudo ldconfig
\end{itemize}

To complete this, we need to create a profile for our architecture, for this go to "/usr/bin/" folder and run "volk\_profile". Note that the configuration file is written in the next path: "\$HOME/.volk/volk\_config".

\subsection{Installing GNU Radio}
Now moving for GNU Radio, the first thing to do is install all the dependencies needed, with the next command:


"sudo apt install cmake git g++ libboost-all-dev python-dev python-mako python-numpy python-wxgtk3.0 python-sphinx python-cheetah swig libzmq3-dev libfftw3-dev libgsl-dev libcppunit-dev doxygen libcomedi-dev libqt4-opengl-dev python-qt4 libqwt-dev libsdl1.2-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev python-gtk2 python-lxml pkg-config python-sip-dev"


After dependencies installed we will install GNU Radio via git. It is available the Version 3.8 however still has a lot of stability problems and bugs so we keep with the last commit of 3.7 version:
\begin{itemize}
    \item git clone https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio.git
    \item cd gnuradio \&\& git checkout maint-3.7
    \item mkdir build \&\& cd build
    \item cmake -DENABLE\_INTERNAL\_VOLK=OFF ..\/
    \item make \&\& make test \&\& sudo make install \&\& sudo ldconfig
\end{itemize}

You can now use the GNU Radio, to see where was installed where it is a usefull command: "which gnuradio-companion".

\subsection{Installing UHD Driver}
To use the USRP's we need to install the UHD Driver, and for that we install three packages:
libuhd-dev, libuhd3.14.1 and uhd-host.
This packages can be downloaded here:
https://launchpad.net/~ettusresearch/+archive/ubuntu/uhd/+packages

Finally to download the image of your USRP just run: 
"./uhd\_images\_downloader.py" inside the folder "/usr/lib/uhd/utils/".

If everything works you can run the next command to see the devices connected:
"uhd\_find\_devices", and this one to see information about that devices: "uhd\_usrp\_probe".


\subsection{Problems and Solutions}
After installing GNU Radio when you open it if shows some warnings about "Camberra" just install it with "sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module"

\section{GUIDED TUTORIAL - MODULATION}

BALBLABLA

\subsection{Tutorial\_1.grc}
    In order to transmit data between SDR's it's necessary modulate the signal, so the modulation is the act of varying properties of a waveform, this wave is called carrier and keeps the information transmitted, so the the goal here is pick the data and modulate it so it can be transmitted.
    
    First we need to understand the working of some blocks and hence the GNU Radio itself. 
    
    %-----------
    
    We can convert bytes in complex numbers using the "Chunks to Symbols" block, this block has a parameter called "Symbol Table" where we define the mapping between a byte (a chunk, this is our symbol) and a constellation point (point in the constellation to the symbol). But before we need to do two things:
        First we need to unpack the byte, this means split the 8 bits/byte in X significant bits/byte being X the number of bits necessary to the symbol of the constellation type, this is, if we want modulate in BPSK X is 1, QPSK X is 2, 8PSK X is 4.
        This is possible using the "Repack Bits" block, this block has 3 important parameters, the "Bits per Input Byte" where we define how many bits we pick in an incoming byte, the "Bits per Output Byte" where we define how many significant bits will have the output byte (the remaining bits will be 0's), and finally the parameter "Endianness" to determinate if we want write in MSB or LSB (always read in LSB). 
        For example if we input the byte = "01000010":
        With 8:2 in MSB we got:"000000\textbf{01}", "000000\textbf{00}", "000000\textbf{00}", "000000\textbf{10}".
        With 8:2 in LSB we got:"000000\textbf{10}", "000000\textbf{00}", "000000\textbf{00}", "000000\textbf{01}".
    Note that this block leads to an interpolation of "Bits per Output Byte/Bits per Input Byte, in this case 8/2=4, this is, for every 1 bytes outputs 4 bytes". 
        
        Second we need to map the resulting bits in the symbols that we really want, using the "Map" block that basically does: output[i] = map[input[i]].
    
    Lets suppose we want modulate using QPSK: 
        First we create an "Constellation Object" where we insert the mapping of the symbols relative to the constellation points. 
        We need to pick the 8 bits/byte and slicing in 2 significant bits per byte, so we use the "repack bits" with 8 "Bits per Input Byte" and 2 "Bits per output Byte" with MSB endianness. Currently we have a byte with the first 6 bits with 0's and the next 2 bits with 2 bits of data, however it's not our symbol wet).
        Then we map this significant 2 bits in the symbol we want taking into account that we will map this symbols in constellation points next (using the "Constellation object" block). In this case the 2 significant bits coincide with the symbol, but it depends of what you want to do.
        Resulting in mapping into the constellation points in the \ref{fig:mapping_qpsk}
        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \includegraphics{mapping_qpsk.jpg}
            \caption{QPSK: Mapping Symbols to Constellation Points}
            \label{fig:mapping_qpsk}
        \end{figure}
        
        The last block is "Throttle", to understand this block we need understand how GR works. When we do data streaming, we are implicitly using a buffers to hold the data between blocks, this buffers are in finite size so before the block do anything, it checks the amount of available space in input and output buffers, if there is none available space in that buffers the block don't do anything. This is called "Back-pressure" because we pressure back the data that is incoming, slowing things down. This is how GR controls the data flow, giving it to the block when it's necessary and holding when block is busy. We have source blocks that provides data at a given sample rate like Audio and USRP blocks, these blocks are called "clock" blocks because they consume/produce data at a fixed and configurable rate, so typically a FG has only or one source or one sink, an not both because that leads to an problem called as "2 clock problem" where there is 2 blocks with different sample rates. As our FG doesn't has any of this "clock" blocks then we need to add the "Throttle" block to act as a clock, without it the FG will run as fast as the CPU can process resulting in non-responsive. This means that while we are in simulating mode we need this block to control things, when we start using the "USRP" block we can take out this block.
        
        To finalize the TX side we send the data to an virtual sink, that redirects the data to the virtual source with the same id, the only purpose of this block it's make the FG more clear, elegant and readable.
        
        Now we move to the RX part of the FG where we use the "Constellation Decoder" to invert what we have done, this is, map the complex points to symbols (using the parameters of the "he "Constellation Object" block), and then we use "Map" block again to map symbols into bits of real data. And then pick the 2 significant bits and pack in a byte exactly the inverse as before.
        
        
\subsection{Tutorial\_2.grc}
        What we have done is not enough because in real world we cant use all the Bandwidth, so we need no narrow bandwidth, if the channels are too narrow the symbols will be too wide and the tail of the last symbol will interfere with the present one inducing ISI (Inter-Symbol Interference). A pulse shaping filter we can use is the RRC (Root Raised Cosine) filter because it's a feasible solution to solve this. 
        
        
        
        
        %--------LER TUDO E MELHORAR
        It uses taps to apply a predefined number of filters against our signal. 
        
        Theoretically has an infinite number of taps so we can infinite attenuate the stop band, so we can define the limit according with processing power we have. Another thing to keep in mind is the roll-off factor, this is the measure of the excess bandwidth of the filter (bandwidth that is occupied beyond Nyquist bandwidth). This parameter is basically the inclination of the wave when rising and falling, when we set more roll-off, let's say 1,  then will be easier for the receiver however the efficiency of bandwidth will be smaller.
        
        
        Smaller roll-off will give narrower bandwidth, however its side lobes increases so attenuation in stop band is reduced
        So we will use 0.22 to this parameter because it's an value already 
        %-filter delay.
        %---SPS - menor melhor mas minimo 2...
        
\subsection{Units}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as Ò3.5-inch disk driveÓ.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ÒWb/m2Ó or Òwebers per square meterÓ, not Òwebers/m2Ó.  Spell out units when they appear in text: Ò. . . a few henriesÓ, not Ò. . . a few HÓ.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: Ò0.25Ó, not Ò.25Ó. Use Òcm3Ó, not ÒccÓ. (bullet list)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Equations}

The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

$$
\alpha + \beta = \chi \eqno{(1)}
$$

Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use Ò(1)Ó, not ÒEq. (1)Ó or Òequation (1)Ó, except at the beginning of a sentence: ÒEquation (1) is . . .Ó

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}
\begin{itemize}


\item The word ÒdataÓ is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ÒoÓ.
\item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ÒinsetÓ, not an ÒinsertÓ. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ÒalternatelyÓ (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ÒessentiallyÓ to mean ÒapproximatelyÓ or ÒeffectivelyÓ.
\item In your paper title, if the words Òthat usesÓ can accurately replace the word ÒusingÓ, capitalize the ÒuÓ; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ÒaffectÓ and ÒeffectÓ, ÒcomplementÓ and ÒcomplimentÓ, ÒdiscreetÓ and ÒdiscreteÓ, ÒprincipalÓ and ÒprincipleÓ.
\item Do not confuse ÒimplyÓ and ÒinferÓ.
\item The prefix ÒnonÓ is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ÒetÓ in the Latin abbreviation Òet al.Ó.
\item The abbreviation Òi.e.Ó means Òthat isÓ, and the abbreviation Òe.g.Ó means Òfor exampleÓ.

\end{itemize}


\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if you filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named ÒHeading 1Ó, ÒHeading 2Ó, ÒHeading 3Ó, and ÒHeading 4Ó are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ÒFig. 1Ó, even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
One & Two\\
\hline
Three & Four\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


   \begin{figure}[thpb]
      \centering
      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.
}}
      %\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figurefile}
      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
      \label{figurelabel}
   \end{figure}
   

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions.
